## Set up your development environment
### Operating system
It's easiest to develop on a linux operating system, which isn't as scary as you might think!  
If you have a mac, you're all set because apple OS is actually based on linux.  If you 
have windows, then the best way to get linux running is to use a virtual machine.  You can 
follow this guide to set up with an OS called Ubuntu:

### Code editor
There are a range of tools that you can use to edit code, which can be very simple 
(notepad) or very complicated (PyCharm).  We're going to split the difference 
and use Sublime:
https://www.sublimetext.com/3

Sublime is nice because it will do 'syntax highlighting', which turns parts of your code 
into colors that make it easier to read.

### Source Control
This website uses an open-source software tool called 'git', which is used by just
about any modern software company to manage versions of code.  It should already
be installed on your computer, but just in case:
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

We'll cover some fundamentals of git, including getting set up to access this
code repository, in the first class.
