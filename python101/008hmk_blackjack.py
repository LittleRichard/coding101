# play a hand of blackjack, not against a dealer

# we don't have a great way of removing cards
# from a deck (yet), so assume you have an 
# infinite deck of cards,

# prompt for input to hit or stay
# implement failure conditions
# do your best with handling the ace as 1 or 11

# you will probably copy-paste if-trees,
# and there is a better way that we haven't
# seen yet (making your own function)

# TODO: good luck!
print("Let's play blackjack!")


# BONUS: could you adjust your game to take
# turns with an opponent? an entire table?
# it might be easier than you think!

# BONUS: BONUS: casinos never close, how can
# you make your blackjack table stay open?

# hint: you COULD copy-paste code, but can
# you re-use your code and instead add 
# another loop plus some if-statements
