## a card number
## a suit number
# assert that the values are
## the right types
## in the range you expect

# move the logic from the 'print a card' assignment
# into your function.  Use the input arguments and
# return the card's name as:
## 'CARD_NAME of SUIT_NAME'
## example: 'Jack of Clubs'





# use your function to print every card in a 
# 52-card deck


# use your function to draw a random hand
# of 5 cards and print it. Don't worry about handling 
# drawing unique cards, you might pull the same one twice
## fixing that will be up next!
