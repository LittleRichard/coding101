# TODO:
# implement the `reversed` function built into python,
# without cheating and using the built-in function!!!


# TODO:
# go back to your blackjack homework (or steal the solution)
# and modify it to use three functions:
# 1) a function that gets a random card (infinite deck)
# 2) a function that prints a card as human-readable
# 3) a function that retrieves a card's value
# hopefully these questions force you to consider which datatype
# you should use to represent the card in your logic!

# note how the complicated bits are much easier to follow

# BONUS: adjust blackjack to use a non-infinite deck, and
# make it play the game until you run out of cards.
