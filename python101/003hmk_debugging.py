# This code has a few bugs in it.  Some are syntax errors, which
# mean that python won't run it and will tell you why.  Some
# make the result of this program not make sense.  

# Learning how to debug code is the most fundamental skill 
# of software development.

# Fix this script so that it runs to completion and makes sense. You
# can fix it (mostly) however you like, as long as it uses string interpolation
# to print the following 3 statements:
# # a correct math equation
# # a realistic observation
# # something truthful

# Tip: Renaming some variables might help you stay sane, but be careful
# you rename ALL references to that variable!
